# bettinson/.dotfiles

This is a configuration/dotfile repository for me to fast track rebuilding my development environment.

## Usage

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bettinson/.dotfiles/master/install-scripts/install.sh | bash
```

After it is done installing, you will want to change the git config from my config to your config like so:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Bobby Joe"
git config --global user.email bobby.joe@example.com
```
